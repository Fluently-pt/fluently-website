## Email Template Best Practices

### Subject Lines

- ‚úÖ "Welcome to UpSpeech, {{to_name}}!"
- ‚úÖ "You're on the UpSpeech waitlist!"
- ‚ùå "Form submission received" (too generic)

### Content Tips

- Personalize with the user's name
- Confirm what they signed up for
- Set clear expectations
- Include next steps
- Add your branding
- Keep it concise but friendly

### Professional Touch

- Use your company email as reply-to
- Include company signature
- Add social media links
- Mention privacy policy if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email not sending**: Check console for errors, verify credentials
2. **Template variables not working**: Ensure exact spelling in template
3. **Emails going to spam**: Use authenticated email service, avoid spam words
4. **Rate limiting**: Free tier has 200 emails/month limit

### Testing

- Test with different email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Check spam folders
- Verify template renders correctly
- Test form validation

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Public key is safe to expose (it's meant to be public)
- Service ID and Template ID are also safe to expose
- Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Monitoring

- Check EmailJS dashboard for delivery rates
- Monitor browser console for errors
- Set up alerts for failed deliveries
- Track conversion rates from email to sign-ups
